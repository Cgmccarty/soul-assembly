    <p class="mt-4">The Soul Assembly is for Dark Souls 3 players who want to plan out their next New Game. If you have ever played
    Dark Souls before, you know it is daunting when you don't know where to start. Even the lowliest enemies can easily
    dispatch you, but having a plan is a great first step when starting a new game. With Soul Assembly, you can plan your
    attributes and your equipment to match your optimal play style, or even to try out a new one!</p>

    <h3 class="mt-5">New Players</h3>

    <p class="mt-4">If you are new to the game, I would highly recommend reading this section in order to get a better grasp of
    some important game concepts.</p>
    <p>Starting off, you need to know something. This game is designed for you to die many times. If you play well, dying is a
    very minor set back in this game. With that being said, let's begin. Souls are the currency of this universe, you collect them
    by killing enemies, bosses, or even finding them in item form on the ground. Souls are your bread and butter, as you will use
    them for leveling up, purchasing anything, and even upgrading your equipment.</p>
