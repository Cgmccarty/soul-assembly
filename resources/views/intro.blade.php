    <p class="mt-4">The Soul Assembly is for Dark Souls 3 players who want to plan out their next New Game. If you have ever played
    Dark Souls before, you know it is daunting when you don't know what to be. Even the lowliest enemies can easily
    dispatch you, but having a plan is a great first step when starting a new game. With Soul Assembly, you can plan your
    attributes, your equipment, and your magic to match your optimal play style, or even to try out a new one!</p>

    <h3 class="mt-5">New Players</h3>

    <p class="mt-4">If you are new to the game, I would highly recommend reading this section in order to get a better grasp of
    some important game concepts.</p>
