    <p class="mt-4">The Soul Assembly is for Dark Souls 3 players who want to plan out their next New Game. If you have ever played
    Dark Souls before, you know it is daunting when you don't know where to start. Even the lowliest enemies can easily
    dispatch you, but having a plan is a great first step when starting a new game. With Soul Assembly, you can plan your
    attributes and your equipment to match your optimal play style, or even learning a new one!</p>

    <h3 class="mt-5">New Players</h3>

    <p class="mt-4">If you are new to the game, I would highly recommend reading this section in order to get a better grasp of
    some important game concepts.</p>

    <p>Dark Souls 3 is an action RPG set in the fictional land of Lothric. Everyone in Lothric is undead, meaning they never truly
    die (sounds kind of like Hell to me). Undead and the world they live in are kept alive by the First Flame. This is the driving
    force behind all life in Lothric. Eventually, though, this flame fades, and begins to die out. When that point comes, a chosen
    undead must reunite the Lords of Cinder so that they may rekindle the First Flame for longevity. Well, as it turns out, rekindling
    the first flame is kind of traumatic, and the lords don't want to do it anymore. So, it's your job to find them, kill them, and
    reunite them by decorating their thrones with their body parts. Sounds easy enough, right?</p>

    <p>You should know that this game is designed for you to die many times. If you play methodically, it is pretty easy to avoid. It
    is crucial to learn how your enemies move and attack, because most of them will respawn if you die. Without learning these patterns,
    every enemy becomes marginally more difficult. So I'll run you through some best practices, and what they can do to keep you alive
    just a little bit longer.</p>

    <p>Creating a character can be a little confusing for the first time. You may not know what all of the items are, what the
    different classes have access to, or how they play. I would suggest starting out by choosing the Knight class. They have strong
    starting armor, high starting health, and a shield that can fully block physical damage (This is more important than you may think).
    For your starting gift, you can choose any number of things. I would advise the Sovereignless Soul, as it is a free 2000 souls
    from the very beginning. You can also choose the Black Firebombs if you want to make your first boss fight a little easier.</p>

    <p>Souls are the currency of this universe, you collect them by killing enemies, bosses, or even finding them in item form.
    Souls are your bread and butter, as you will use them for leveling up, purchasing anything, and even upgrading your equipment.
    You can check at any time how many souls you need to level up in the in-game player menu. Simply by staying aware of this, you
    can stay on top of spending your souls properly and not losing them to repeated deaths. When spending your souls, I would advise
    burning a hole in your pocket, so to speak. Spend all the time, and spend on whatever you feel you need. You will quickly learn
    what you do and don't need. By spending to 0, you minimize the amount of souls you can lose through death.</p>

    <p>When leveling up, the first attribute to start spending on is your vigor. The more health you have, the longer you can stay alive,
    which allows for more mistakes, which we all make. At around 25-30 vigor, the next I would recommend working on is your primary damage
    attribute. You can find out by looking at the highest scaling attribute on the weapon you find yourself using the most. From lowest
    to highest, the scaling ratings go: <strong><i>E-->D-->C-->B-->A-->S</i></strong>. E being the lowest, S being the highest. If you
    find yourself struggling with stamina, you can pump up your endurance some, it doesn't take much to make a decent difference.</p>

    <p>Playing defensively is key to being successful in this game. If you aren't blocking an enemy's attacks, then you should be
    rolling through them (more on this in a moment). When you block, each attack blocked drains stamina. You can't block all day, or
    your defenses will be broken, and you will take more damage as a result. So, block a few attacks, wait for a gap, then attack a few
    times. How many times you can attack during this gap will depend on your enemy, as some just recover faster than others. Be patient,
    and don't rush to get one extra attack in. The risk is almost never worth it, and generally results in dying, or coming very close.</p>

    <p>Rolling is potentially your best friend in this game. For a very small window of time when you roll, you are quite literally
    invincible. This is not a bug, this is a feature. It allows well timed rolling to be capable of mitigating almost any damage.
    Generally speaking, you want to roll while an enemy is mid-swing. Timing is key. Learning to take advantage of this feature will
    keep you alive longer than nearly every other tactic in the game. It also allows you to position yourself for critical attacks, or just
    to get to a more comfortable position for yourself. Similar to blocking, rolling requires stamina. Keep an eye on your usage, and
    there shouldn't be any trouble.</p>

    <p>The last important skill to have in this game is backstabbing. You simply sneak up directly behind an unsuspecting enemy, perform
    a fast attack, and a special animation should play based on what kind of weapon you are wielding. These high damage attacks can
    easily eliminate weaker enemies, and deal significant chunks of damage to the tougher ones. Not all enemies can be attacked this way,
    and it is worth noting that this is generally only the largest of enemies.</p>

    <p class="mb-5">Taking the time to learn these mechanics will only serve to make you better at the game. Remember, you will die, you will have
    to replay sections that you have already played, and you will have to fight often. Patience and strategy will absolutely keep you
    alive, and planning your build will help to keep you focused on how to play optimally. Whether you choose to be a sturdy knight,
    an incisive ninja, or a staunch cleric, knowing what attributes and equipment you need will set you ahead.</p>
